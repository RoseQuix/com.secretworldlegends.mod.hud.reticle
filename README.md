# Descendent's Reticle HUD

This `rose-special` branch is dedicated to more esoteric and changes of questionable value to Descendent's Reticle HUD mod.

For changes that have a reasonably high chance of making their way to the original project, see the `develop` branch. For the original mod, see [Descendent's Github page](https://github.com/Descendent/com.secretworldlegends.mod.hud.reticle).

Differences between `rose-special` and `develop` are:

 * Uses the DefaultArcBar for VitalityGauge's instead of the ReflectArcBar
 * Custom HP thresholds marked on certain dungeon bosses (WIP)
 * Barriers are purple instead of yellow
 
 Y'all're welcome to make use of this version if you want, but don't be mad if I break your favorite part horribly in my little branch here.
